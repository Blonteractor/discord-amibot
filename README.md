# Discord Student Portal Bot

This is a Discord bot that allows users to access their student portal directly in Discord. The bot is written in Rust and uses [go-amizone](https://github.com/ditsuke/go-amizone) as its backend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Rust and its package manager, Cargo, if you haven't already.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `cargo build`.
4. Create a Discord bot and obtain its token.
5. Set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable to your bot's token.
6. Run the bot by running `cargo run`.

## Commands

The bot currently has no commands as I started working on it yesterday but here's some random shit chatgpt wrote which will eventually be true:

-   `!attendance`: Displays the user's attendance for the current semester.
-   `!marks`: Displays the user's marks for the current semester.
